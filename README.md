# Auth workflow

    Frontend->>+Backend: POST /v1/auth/register
    Backend->>Database: Write user data, hashed password, verified = false
    Backend->>-User: Send token verification link via email
    User->>Frontend: Click link to send token
    Frontend->>Backend: POST /v1/auth/verify-email: Send token data
    alt token is valid
        Backend->>Database: Update verified = true
        Backend->>Frontend: Response success
        Frontend->>User: Show success, redirect to login
    else token is not valid
        Backend->>Frontend: Response error
        Frontend->>User: Show error
        note over Frontend,User: User can login to send another verification email

# Todo next

- Now the access token expires in 1 day. I will change it to be less lifetime and create another refresh token for more security.
- Implement social login.
- Implement Redis cache to reduce reading the firestore database directly.
- Make user can create API key so user can access their own raw data.
